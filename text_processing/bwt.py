"""
    The Burrows-Wheeler transform rearranges strings into runs of similar characters.
    This is useful for compression since it tends to be easy to compress a string that has runs
    of repeated characters with techniques such as move-to-front transform and run-length encoding.
    Most importantly BWT is reversible.
